This is where I am going to be working on a personal project to keep my skills fresh while job hunting.

Its going to be a react website and a react native app that provides weather forecast information from multiple sources that can be compared to attempt to get a more accurate prediction of the weather.
It will start off with a simple design of some simple screens just polling and surfacing data from a few sources but this will expanded out as I get time to work on it
